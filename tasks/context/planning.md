## Plan for Defining Rules for Additional Roles

### Objective

Define comprehensive rules for the following roles:

1. **Document Role** (`.roo/rules-document/document.md`)
2. **Project Manager Role** (`.roo/rules-project-manager/manage.md`)
3. **Tester Role** (`.roo/rules-tester/testing.md`)

### Approach

1. **Research and Analysis**

   - Review existing rules in `.roo/rules/` and its subdirectories for consistency and alignment.
   - Identify gaps or unique requirements for each role.

2. **Draft Rules**

   - Create initial drafts for each role based on project objectives and best practices.
   - Ensure alignment with the project's locale and technical standards.

3. **Validation**

   - Validate the drafted rules against the project's objectives and team feedback.
   - Incorporate feedback to refine the rules.

4. **Implementation**

   - Write the finalized rules into the respective files:
     - `.roo/rules-document/document.md`
     - `.roo/rules-project-manager/manage.md`
     - `.roo/rules-tester/testing.md`

5. **Documentation**
   - Update `tasks/context/activity.md` with a summary of the changes.
   - Record insights and learnings in `tasks/context/learnings.md`.

### Timeline

- **Day 1**: Research and draft rules.
- **Day 2**: Validate and refine drafts.
- **Day 3**: Finalize and implement rules.

### Next Steps

- Begin with research and drafting for the Document role.
- Proceed sequentially to the Project Manager and Tester roles.
