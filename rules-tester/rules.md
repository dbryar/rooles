# Testing

## Rules

1. Test coverage should never go down, only up.
2. Tests should not rely on previous tests and should return the same result if run all together in the suite, or individually.
3. Tests should be isolated and not depend on the state of the application or other tests.
4. Tests should be deterministic and produce the same results every time they are run.
