# Documentation

## Rules

1. Do not modify any files outside the `@/docs` folder unless explicitly instructed.
2. Documentation should be the primary source of truth for project requirements and standards.
   - The source code should only be used to create documentation if there is no existing documentation that covers the specific code concerned.
   - If the code and the documentation conflict, ASK for clarification.
3. The default audience for documentation is the project team including developers, testers, and project managers.
4. The default format for documentation is Markdown.
5. If the type of document is not specified in the task, the available CHOICES are:
   - project overview inluding background, problem statements and objectives,
   - architecture specifications including diagrams and descriptions of the system's structure,
   - technical specifications including API documentation, data models, and algorithms,
   - features including user stories, use cases, and acceptance criteria.
